## What did we learn?

### Ditching

- The benefits of using R over point-and-click software for data analysis in biological and biomedical sciences are that it is open-source, it has a wide and diverse community with a huge number of resources, it is relatively easy to learn, and it offers workflows that is very well suited for doing reproducible and responsible data analysis.
- The tidyverse offers advantages over base R. It offers an intuitive way of coding with functional names and tidy data handling and coding in mind
- R in the browser offers easy access to R without installing software

### Cars

- General R coding and execution of code
- How to look at data tables: `head`, `tail`, `glimpse`
- The pipe operator `%>%` or `|>`
- Making factorial data using `as.factor`
- the `dplyr` function `select` 
- basic `ggplot` functions using `aes` aesthetics and geoms such as `geom_point`
- adding `color` and `shape` and using `scale_brewer_manual` and `scale_shape`
- improving layout; `theme_bw`, `base_size` and `labs`
- using chatGPT for coding improvements


### Seahorse

- Loading data and working with typical Seahorse data 
- Using `janitor` `clean_names`
- Using the `dplyr` function `filter`
- Using the `%in%` operator
- Changing the layout of ggplots usine `theme` elements and arguments.
- adding text to ggplot using `geom_text` and `annotate`
- Adding lines to ggplot using `geom_vline`
- nesting pipes in ggplot function for subsetting data
- Using `facet_wrap` to make multiple similar plots from one datatable
- Using the `forcats` `fct_reorder` function
- Changing data formats to numbers using `as.double`
- Using the dplyr `summarize` function
- Using `stat_summary` to compute means or medians in ggplots
- Using `geom_smooth` to make regression lines

## What we did not learn?

- base R functions and how to address data in base R, eg `xf$OCR[xf$Group == "Background]` and `xf$Well[10]`
- other important tidyverse functions, like `pivot_wider`, `pivot_longer`, 
- more complicated functions like the `map` function from the `purrr` package
- other simple ggplot geoms, like `geom_bar`, `geom_boxplot`, `geom_density`
- how to save images and plots for using them in other software
